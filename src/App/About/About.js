                A recent MU survey revealed that 48% of musicians have been

                We want to build up a picture of the problems that exist and
                seek long term solutions. We are campaigning for laws to protect
                musicians at work, and are on a mission to create cultural
                change within the music industry.

                We always start from a position of belief. We never blame
                victim. We understand that the survivor is never responsible.

                We aim for Safe Space to be a safe place for survivors to report
                without fear of unwanted consequences.

                However, there may come a point where we cannot maintain
